#Bootstrap Install
Install bootstrap using npm install --save bootstrap@3
In angular.json file update styles with bootstrap path in node modules. 
Check whether bootstrap has installed properly or not by inspecting html page style tags after you run the app.

#use ng serve --port 4000 to change port number, default port is 4200.

#How an angular app gets loaded and started

main.ts file contains bootstrapModule as AppModule (this tells angular to load that component
at the time of bootstrap) & import AppModule.
In AppModule.ts file bootstrap array we add AppComponent.
index.html file is the only file served by the server. It contains Js script imports which 
will be loaded first and executed at runtime.
index.html contains <app-root> (which is a selector in app.component.ts). app.component.ts file
has html file which is loads its content in between <app-root> tag.

#components
Easy to exchange, used for re-use.
egs : navbar, main area, side bar.

Root component is app.component in which different selectors in the app will be added.

## Create new component

### manually
create components in app folder. 
Register new component in app.module.ts file declarations & import new component from its respective
path.
Add the new component selector in app.component.html file to use the new component.

### Through CLI
ng generate component [component Name] or ng g c [component Name]  command generates ts,css,html, spec file 
of the new component and adds the component in app.module.ts automatically.

template (in-line html code) or templateUrl should be present for a component. Use styles tag array
to add in-line styles.

### selectors in components
selectors should be unique and can be different types like element, attribute or class.
eg: selector:'app-server' or '[app-server]' or '.app-server'

### constructor
Its is called at the time of component creation by angular.

### Nest components
nest components by adding their selectors in different components

#modules
used to bundle different components into packages.
@NgModule in app.module.ts file has declarations in which we mention components, imports in which 
we mention different module needed to import. 

#Data Binding = communication
 
## Typescript code (Business Logic)   --->(output data)  Template(HTML)    use 

 string interpolation (  {{data}} ) - should return a string as the result (a num will be converted to string )
 property Binding ( [property]="data" )

### property Binding vs string interpolation
 To output/print data use string interpolation and to change a property use property Binding


 ##Typescript code (Business Logic)   <---(React to user events)  Template(HTML)    use 

 Event Binding ( (event)="expression" )

 ##combination of both: two-way-Binding ( [(ngModel)]="data" )
 For Two-Way-Binding to work, you need to enable the ngModel  directive. 
 This is done by adding the FormsModule  to the imports[]  array in the AppModule.
 You then also need to add the import from @angular/forms  in the app.module.ts file:
 import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'; 

 #Directives
 Instructions to the DOM. components are Directives with a template.
 ##Structural Directives : changes the DOM. Starts with a *
 eg: *ngIf="", element will be added only when the condition is true.
ng-template is a component/directive which can be used to mark templates in the DOM.

## attribute Directives
Unlike Structural Directives, these dont add or remove elements. They only change the element
they were plced on.
eg: [ngStyle]="{'background-color': 'red'}" or [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: 'red'}" or
[ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: getColor()}"
